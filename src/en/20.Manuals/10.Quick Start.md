::: tip
If there is no corresponding format, it is recommended that you choose the mkv format
:::
- The output folder should be set on a drive with a large amount of free space as much as possible, and try not to set it on the drive of the mobile hard disk to avoid unexpected disk drops
- The remaining space of the system disk should not be less than 1G
- Before starting the task, check whether the options "Keep Audios" and "Keep Subtitles" are enabled. If checked, the audio and subtitle tracks of the original video can be retained.

- If Only performing super-resolution is desired, please switch the "Interpolate ratio" as 1x, and click the “Encode” to start the task; for frame rate interpolation and super-resolution at the same time, click the Interpolate (consumes more video memory)

::: tip
**Super-resolution function is only available in the professional version**
