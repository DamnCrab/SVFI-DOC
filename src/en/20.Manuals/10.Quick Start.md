**If you haven't used the software yet, please read the [Newbie Tutorial](/en/pages/svfi-quick-start/)**

Before you officially use the software, please be sure to read the following:

- Be sure to set and confirm the output folder before starting the task

- Please note that the output video file format should be as consistent as possible with the video input file format
  
   **Example as follows**

::: tip
If there is no corresponding format, it is recommended that you choose the mkv format
:::
- The output folder should be set on a drive with a large amount of free space as much as possible, and try not to set it on the drive of the mobile hard disk to avoid unexpected disk drops
- The remaining space of the system disk should not be less than 1G
- Before starting the task, check whether the options "Export with audio" and "export with subtitles" are enabled. If checked, the audio and subtitle tracks of the original video can be retained without loss

- Only perform super-resolution, please select the frame rate multiple as 1x, and click the Encode to start the task; for frame rate interpolation and super-resolution at the same time, click the Interpolate (consumes more video memory)

::: tip
**Super-resolution function is only available in the professional version**
