</div>


### Auto Configure
::: tip
When the program exits due to a power outage in the middle of the task or the termination of the task due to other circumstances, you can click "**Auto Configure**" to restore the last block position.
:::

Before clicking this button, please click on the task entry to restore the progress. Then click "**Interpolate**", the software will pop up a window to confirm the starting position of supplementary frame.


<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/13_en.png"  width=300>
</div>


### Start point and End point

You can choose the time period that needs to be supplemented

<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/6_en.png"  width=300>
</div>


>**Input format: hours:minutes:seconds**

::: warning Warning
After specifying the start and end complement frame time, progress recovery is not supported after manual termination or power failure
:::

### Start block count and start input frame number
It is used when the automatic search progress fails or the starting position of the supplementary frame needs to be manually specified, and it can be used to manually restore the progress of the supplementary frame

- Starting block count = **last chunk number exported in the output folder + 1** (for example chunk-001 in the picture, the starting block count should be **1+1=2**)
- Start input frame number = `single output block size * (start block count - 1)` in output quality settings (render settings)

<div align=center>

</div>


<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/10_en.png"  width=300>
</div>


As shown above, a video chunk has 1000 frames

### Return to origin

Return the initial block and the initial input frame number to the original value, and **start supplementary frames from zero time**.

<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/11_en.png"  width=300>
</div>

### Risk Mode

When you need to restore the progress of the task, enabling this option can **reduce the time required for the program to restore the progress**, but enabling it may cause **audio and video to be out of sync**,
**Not recommended to enable**.

## Transition recognition

<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/13_en.png"  width=300>
</div>

### Enable transition recognition

Recognize scene switching

In order to avoid the **jelly effect** when the scene is switched during the supplementary frame process, it is recommended that you enable transition recognition.

After checking Enable Transition Recognition, generally select 12 for the parameter value below; if you find that the final exported video is lagging, you can consider adjusting it to 15;
If you find that there are many **jelly effects**, you can consider adjusting the parameter value to 9, and the parameter value range is generally 9-15.

**As shown in the picture: jelly produced by missed judgment in transition**

<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/14_en.png"  width=300>
</div>


### Maximum recognition threshold (no need to adjust by default)

When **use fixed transition recognition** is not enabled, the recommended value is 80-90

When **Use Fixed Transition Recognition** is turned on, the recommended value is 40-60

### Use fixed transition recognition

Use a fixed threshold (maximum recognition threshold) to identify transitions (unstable), only used when the default transition detection is inaccurate, such as mixed cuts with a lot of shots.

### Transitions use frame blending

The traditional method is to copy the previous frame as a transition frame. The method is to blend the two frames before and after (gradient)

### Output transition frame

Transition frames in the output video.
The transition frames will be accompanied by relevant judgment information, and will be output in png format in the scene folder of the project folder.

## Output resolution setting

<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/15_en.png"  width=300>
</div>

### Output file resolution

The drop down box is used for resolution preset selection.
When the preset is Custom, you can set the final output resolution of the video. SVFI will first adjust the resolution of the picture, and then make up frames.

### Output black edge length

It can be used to crop the black border in the video, and the width and height need to be specified manually.

> Example: video <Badge text="Note"/> has a resolution of 3840x2160, and the actual screen resolution is 3840x1620, then fill in `270 = (original height - actual height) รท 2` for **height** here.

<Badge text="Note" vertical="middle"/>: If AI super resolution is used, the video here refers to the final output video

> Example: The input video is 1920x1080, the actual resolution is 1920x800, and the super resolution 2 times the output is 3840x1600. Then the height of the black border is 280, and the output resolution can be customized to 3840x1600

::: tip
If you input **-1** for width and height, SVFI will automatically recognize the black border of the input video and crop it
:::

### Complete the black border after processing

After removing the black borders, perform processing (frame supplementation or super resolution), and then automatically add back the black borders after the frames are completed.
::: tip
To a certain extent, the calculation amount of a single frame can be reduced and the processing speed can be accelerated.

## Use AI Super Resolution

::: tip
This function requires the purchase of [Professional DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718750/SVFI_Professional/)
:::

To make the video picture clearer, it currently supports 9 effective super resolution algorithms.

>Process animation material: Anime4K, AnimeSR, realCUGAN, realESR, waifu2x, waifuCuda
>
>Process real footage: BasicVSR series, FTVSR, NvidiaSR, realESR

::: tip
SVFI's definition of animation material and live-action material is as follows:

- **Anime** material is a motion video clip mainly composed of flat image layers, **each layer has a clear border with another layer**. For example, hand-painted 2D animation, most three-rendered two-screen, etc.

- **Actual Shot** Materials are real-world pictures or computer-generated pictures taken with a single-view camera, **the naked eye cannot distinguish the layers and their boundaries**. Such as live-action movies, 3D CG, 3D game screens, etc.

In particular, we consider animations made of 3D/3G backgrounds + 2D characters as animation materials.

### load graphics card

Specify which graphics card to use for super resolution

### super resolution Algorithm

Select the algorithm used for super resolution

### Super resolution model multiple

The overresolution multiple of the currently selected model

### Transfer Resolution Ratio

First scale the original video according to the percentage set by the user, and then perform super resolution.

>Example: Original video 1920x1080, transfer resolution ratio 50%, model magnification 4x

Running process: 1920x1080 -> 960x540 (down scaling) -> 3840x2160 (super resolution)

### RealCUGAN cutting mode
dedicated to realCUGAN, the more you cut, the more memory you save

- No Tile: no cutting is used

- 1/2 on Width: Horizontally divided into two

- 1/2 on both W and H: Horizontally and vertically divided into two

- 1/3 on w & h: cut lengthwise and lengthwise into thirds

- 1/4 on w & h: cut into quarters lengthwise and lengthwise

### RealCUGAN low memory mode
dedicated to realCUGAN, used when the video memory of the graphics card is insufficient

- Low VRAM Mode: enable low VRAM mode

- None: Do not use low memory mode

### Cutting block size (it is not recommended to open when using realCUGAN)

- There are presets for video memory size, and you can also choose to customize the adjustment

### Super-score sequence length
It is only valid when a super resolution algorithm that requires multi-frame input, such as the BasicVSR series, is selected

- The larger the length of the super resolution sequence, the more frames are input for a single super resolution, and the texture is more stable, but at the same time it will increase the video memory usage,
- It is recommended to keep the value above 10. If the video memory is insufficient, it is recommended to reduce the screen resolution and ensure that the value is above 5

<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/20_en.png"  width=300>
</div>


### Super resolution using half precision

- It is recommended to enable it, which can greatly reduce the video memory usage and have little impact on the picture quality.
- For nVidia's 10xx series Pascal architecture graphics card, it will slow down the super resolution speed

### TTA
It is only supported by ncnnCUGAN, which consumes a lot of time in exchange for a small improvement in image quality

### FMNet - HDR10
::: tip
This feature is only available in the public beta version
:::
Convert SDR video to HDR10 with AI algorithm


## Output settings (suppression parameter quality)

::: tip
Only for super resolution, please click one-click suppression to start the task;
If you want to make supplementary frame super resolution at the same time, please click one-key supplementary frame
:::

::: warning Warning
At the same time, performing supplementary frame super resolution will consume more video memory, and insufficient video memory may cause the task to fail.

If the video memory is less than 10G, it is recommended to use one-key suppression to complete the super resolution first, and then perform frame supplementation.
:::

### Render Quality CRF

It is used to adjust the quality loss when exporting video, and it is positively correlated with **output bit rate**. Using different compression codecs and compression presets will affect the CRF.

**CRF numerical parameters are generally 16**, which is not lossy to the naked eye at this time; for H.265 encoding, the bit rate will drop significantly. **Please judge whether the CRF value is reasonable based on the image quality seen by the naked eye. **
If it is used as a favorite CRF value parameter, it can be set to 12**. **The smaller the value of CRF, the smaller the image loss after the operation process, and the larger the volume (bit rate) of the exported finished video. **

   **Note: The same value, the output quality of different encoders are different**

### target bit rate

As an optional option to replace the rendering quality CRF, it is basically the same as the setting standards of Primer Pro, After Effects, and DaVinci Resolve

### Encoder

   - **AUTO**
     Automatically determine encoder options based on the slide bar below the software
   - **CPU**
     If you select this option, **the quality is the highest, but the CPU usage is also the highest**. **The performance of the CPU** determines whether it will be blocked during frame supplementation or super resolution (resulting in a decrease in graphics card usage), and the **time to complete** the final operation.
   - **NVENC**
     This option is only available for **NVIDIA graphics cards** that support NVENC function. If your graphics card does not **support NVENC function, please do not select this option**.
     Please refer to the NVIDIA NVENC Gen.pdf in the installation directory to check whether your graphics card supports NVENC
   - **VCE**
     This option is only **available for AMD graphics cards** that support VCE function, if your graphics card does not **support VCE function, please do not select this option**.
   - **QSV**
     This option is only supported by users with **Intel Core Graphics** (such as Intel UHD 630, IrisPro 580), and users who are not of this type should not choose it.

   ::: tip
   The following encoders need to purchase [Professional DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718750/SVFI_Professional/)
   :::

   - **NVENCC** is an optimized version of **NVENC**, with faster processing speed and better quality of works.
   - **QSVENCC** is an optimized version of **QSV**, which can complete tasks more efficiently.
   - **VCENCC** is an optimized version of **VCE**, which can complete tasks more efficiently.

Perceptual comparison:

| Encoders | Using Hardware | Speed | Quality | File Size | Selection Recommendations |
| ------ | --------- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| CPU | CPU | Medium | High | Medium | Pursue image quality and encoding stability and A card user AU user selection |
| NVENC | Ncard | Fast | Medium |
| QSV | Intel Core Graphics | Fast | Medium |


### Select compression encoding

For the selection of this function, you need to have certain **common sense of video suppression**.

::: warning Warning 

If you are new to suppression, please keep the following rules in mind:

- HDR output must choose **H.265 10bit** encoding
- Be sure to choose **H.265** encoding for resolutions above 2K (especially 4K, 8K resolutions)
- If there are problems with both H.264 and H.265 encoding, use **ProRes** encoding. This encoding output is closest to the lossless naked eye, and the bit rate is extremely high. It is an intermediate encoding format for editing work.
- It is recommended to use H.265 fast encoding or ProRes encoding
:::

### Select suppress preset

- CPU: English meaning **The faster the speed, the lower the quality of the work, otherwise the higher the quality**.

- NVENC (only for N card): It is recommended to choose p7 without brain

- QSV (for Intel graphics card): Select slow directly

- VCE (only for A card): directly select quality

- NVENCC (only for N card): directly select quality

- QSVENCC (for Intel graphics card): choose best directly

- VCENCC (only for A card): directly select slow

### NVIDIA card hard-coded preset

When selecting the NVENC encoder, the N card hard-coded preset can reduce the exported video volume without changing the picture quality. You need to check which generation of NVENC compression chip your N card is. If it exceeds 7th, directly select 7th+

### Default suppression scheme

Using the traditional compression scheme, the compatibility is strong, and the exported video volume may increase.

::: tip
Enabling this feature can solve most broken pipe problems.
:::

### Audio secondary pressure to AAC

- Re-encode the audio (usually used on videos uploaded to the platform)
- Compress all audio tracks in the video to **640kbps aac format**.

### HDR Strict Mode

Handle HDR content with strict presets, enabled by default

### DV Compatible with HDR10

Enable HDR10 compatibility when outputting in Dolby Vision, which is enabled by default

### One-click HDR: Convert SDR video to HDR10+
Four one-click HDR modes need to try the effect by yourself

## Decoding quality control

### Use vspipe pre-decoding

Use vspipe as a pre-decoder, this function is a prerequisite for many specific functions (such as decolorization, fast noise addition, QTGMC deinterlacing),

If you find that he can't decode the input or the task reports an error, please close it

### Hardware decoding

It can reduce the decoding pressure of high-resolution video, but it may **reduce the picture quality** to a certain extent, and cause the frame supplement module to **explode video memory** when the video memory is tight.

### Quick frame splitting

Fast frame splitting can **reduce the decoding pressure**, but it may **result in deviations in the color of the picture**.

### High precision optimization workflow

::: tip
This function requires the purchase of [Professional DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718750/SVFI_Professional/)
:::

- If the CPU performance is excessive, it is recommended that you enable this function, which can **solve the color deviation problem of most pictures**, and can solve the color deviation problem caused by HDR video compression to the greatest extent. This feature will **increase the CPU burden**, and even affect the speed of supplementary frames.
- Turning on this function for super resolution work will **turn off half-precision** (requires more video memory). Please **select as appropriate**.
::: tip
It is recommended to enable this option when inputting HDR video
:::

### Turn on deinterlacing

::: tip
This function requires the purchase of [Professional DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718750/SVFI_Professional/)
:::

- Use **ffmpeg** to deinterlace input **interlaced video**.

- When using vspipe pre-decoding, use QTGMC to deinterlace the picture

### DePan (De-ribbon)

Use depanStabilise in vs to handle ribbons

### Fast Noise Reduction

::: tip
This function requires the purchase of [Professional DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718750/SVFI_Professional/)
:::

If there is no special need for the "Quick" option under this column, please keep it off, otherwise it will **slow down the task processing speed**.

::: tip
It is recommended to test whether this option can improve the picture quality by controlling variables by yourself.

Incompatible with high precision optimization workflows
:::

### Add noise quickly

Add noise to video, often used for video overtime

### Custom frame splitting parameters (professional option)

Used to replace the parameters used by ffmpeg or vspipe for decoding, use || intervals between custom parameters

## Custom encoding settings

### Specify the number of encoding threads

When the encoder is a CPU, there is a chance to control the CPU usage to control the rendering speed.

### Custom suppression parameters

This function is a professional option (note that the number of input items must be **even number**),

The key value is separated by `||`

> Example: Custom suppression parameters for CPU h265 suppression:
>
> -x265-params||ref=4:me=3:subme=4:rd=4:merange=38:rdoq-level=2:rc-lookahead=40:scenecut=40:strong-intra-smoothing=0

### Time Remapping: Change the speed of the video

::: tip
This function requires the purchase of [Professional DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718750/SVFI_Professional/)
:::

- This function is used to make "slow motion" clips.

- For example, if the output frame rate is set to 120 frames, and the time remapping is set to 60 frames, the output effect is equivalent to 50% **Playback speed slowed down**.

- Other situations can be analogized in turn, you can set the output frame rate by yourself, **decimals are supported**.

::: warning Warning
For animation materials, please enable **Space-Time Resampling** in **Video Fluency Optimization** in **Fixed Frame Settings** as much as possible.

Or use software such as Premiere to reduce the frame rate of the original video to complete the removal of duplicate frames to avoid stuttering after remapping.

The original video frame rate is generally reduced to 8 or 12 frames
:::

### Head and tail loop

Putting the last frame in the first frame to fit some end-to-end looping videos

## IO control

<div align=center>
<img src="/Statics/UserGuide/23_en.png"  width=300>
</div>


### Manually specify the buffer memory size

If the running memory is tight (less than 16G), it is recommended to **manually specify the buffer memory size** to be 2-3G to avoid **out of memory** errors.

### Single output block size

- For frame complementing and compression tasks, a small clip without audio will be output every time the number of frames rendered is this value, so that you can **preview the effect** conveniently.
- The clips will be generated in the output folder you set, **and merged into one file** after the frame or compression task is completed.

### Keep the project folder after the task is completed

**Do not delete the chunk video** generated in the middle after the supplementary frame is completed.

## VFI setting

### **Safe Frame Rate**

If the video is to be uploaded to the corresponding media platform for online viewing, please enable this option
::: tip
If you find a blurred video screen when playing a video, it is most likely a problem with the decoder. Please try to change the decoder or check this option to reduce the decoding pressure.
:::

### **Reverse Optical Flow**

This function can make the picture **more silky** to a certain extent.

### **absolutely smooth**

This function may make the screen **more silky**, just enable it by default (if it is not available, it will not be enabled when the software is running)

### **Optical Flow Scale**

- When using the RIFE algorithm, when the original video size is 1080P, the default setting is 0.5, 4K and above is 0.25, and less than 1080P is 1.0

- When using the GMFSS algorithm, when the original video size is 1080P, 1.0 is set by default, 0.5 is set for 4K and above, and 1.0 is set for less than 1080P

### **Interlaced frame interpolation**

- Equivalent to a special cut, used to reduce video memory usage

- Appropriate selection of this item can make the graphics card with small video memory supplement the super-large resolution (such as 4G complement 8K)

### Video fluency optimization

- **Space-time linearization**: Enhance the smoothness of the picture when the output frame rate is 60 (TruMotion)**( general )**
- **Fixed Threshold Deduplication**: It is used to alleviate the **picture stuttering** caused by repeated frames. The general value is 0.2, and 0.5 is used for animation, 1.0 or higher **(General)**
- **Remove 1 shot 2**: Specially for animation, some materials perform better, but in most cases, duplicate frames cannot be completely removed, and it is easy to introduce stuttering. **(anime) (outdated, use spatio-temporal resampling is recommended)**
- **Space-time resampling**: Completely remove the stuttering of animation video materials, please ensure that the input frame rate is around 24, and the output frame rate can only be an integer multiple of (input frame rate/2)**(anime) (only supported Algorithms and frame complement models available at any time) **
- **First-order difference deduplication**: Anime deduplication **(Obsolete)**

::: warning Warning
Due to the limited ability of AI frame supplementation in animation frame supplementation at this stage, choosing deduplication will increase the motion range between frames, resulting in picture distortion when supplementing frames. Please choose the best deduplication for each input video control variable by yourself. heavy mode.

It is recommended that you choose the deduplication mode carefully. If you need to supplement frames for the entire animation, it is not recommended to enable deduplication.
:::

**After enabling video fluency optimization (time-space resampling), the effect of supplementary frame is as follows**

### **Load Graphics Card**

Specify which graphics card to use for supplementary frames

### frame interpolation algorithm

Select the frame interpolation algorithm (including RIFE, IFRNet, DAIN, GMFSS, EMA)

### VFI model

::: tip
Models with `ncnn` use [ncnn](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn) as the forward reasoning framework, which is compatible with N cards and A cards, and models without this word cannot be used for A card and display.

### **TTA mode**

::: tip
This function requires the purchase of [Professional DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718750/SVFI_Professional/)
:::

>Enable this function to **reduce picture jelly, reduce subtitle jitter, and reduce the problem of objects disappearing**. Make the picture more **smooth and comfortable**
>
>**Additional frame supplement time is required, and some frame supplement models do not support this function**.
>
>The bigger the number behind, the slower the speed, and the less jelly, generally fill in 1 or 2.
>
> sideways, suitable for rife, 3.x series models
>
>Medium orientation, suitable for rife, 2.x series models

### output layer fine-tuning mode (only available for experimental models)

>residual: It will make the picture blurred, but the structure is more complete
>
>direct: direct output, the picture is clearer

### **Bidirectional Optical Flow**

>The speed is reduced by about half, and the effect is slightly improved (the rife 3.8 model must be turned on) (the rife 4.x model is not supported yet).

### **Dynamic Optical Flow Scale**

::: tip
This function requires the purchase of [Professional DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1718750/SVFI_Professional/)
:::

>Dynamically select the optical flow scale during the frame complementing process, which can reduce the problem of object disappearance and reduce jelly. It is recommended to enable it.
