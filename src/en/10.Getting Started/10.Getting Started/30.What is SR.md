## SR = Super Resolution = Upscale

Improve the video resolution through some specific algorithms, that is, increase the resolution of each frame of the video to make the look and feel clearer.

Common algorithms include [BICUBIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicubic_interpolation), [LANCZOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanczos_algorithm), etc., which are not implemented by AI, commonly known as "Resize".

SVFI uses deep network-based artificial intelligence algorithm [RealESR](https://github.com/xinntao/Real-ESRGAN), [RealCUGAN](https://github.com/bilibili/ailab/tree/main/Real-CUGAN) for super-resolution, and its super-resolution effect on animation is better than other algorithms.

::: tip
For the processing task of the same video, SVFI will perform super resolution first, and then perform frame supplementation
