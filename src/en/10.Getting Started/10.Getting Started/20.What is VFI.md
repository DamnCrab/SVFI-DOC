## Video Frame Interpolation = VFI

Frame interpolation refers to improving the video frame rate through certain specific algorithms, that is, inserting new frames that are not included in the original video between frames to make the look and feel smoother.

Common algorithms include "MEMC" based on [hardware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_compensation), the software-based [optical flow method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow).

SVFI uses the deep learning-based frame interpolation algorithm [RIFE and its derivatives](https://github.com/megvii-research/ECCV2022-RIFE) to complement the frame, and its effect is better than other algorithms.
