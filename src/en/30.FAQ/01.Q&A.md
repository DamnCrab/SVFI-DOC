### The software prompts that the video memory is insufficient or how to solve the problem of insufficient memory

Insufficient video memory:

- Frame supplement **1080P video** requires at least **2G video memory**, **4K video** requires at least **6G video memory**. Please try to enable interleaved frames to avoid exceeding the video memory limit.

- If you are sure that the video memory of your machine is large enough, you can try **restart the machine to see if it solves the problem**.

- In the output resolution setting, to reduce the video resolution, you can try to turn on the half-precision mode in the output quality setting. You can also try to lower the optical flow scale in the supplementary frame setting (setting **2.0 and above** will greatly increase the memory usage, please be sure to check the value of this option).

Not enough storage:

   - For machines with a running memory below 16G, it is recommended to use the **Manually specify the buffer memory size** function in **Output Quality Settings** to specify the memory usage size. Recommended minimum value: 2G.

### Is it possible to restore the progress if the frame complement is quit in the middle? Can't find progress?

- To **Work Status Recovery** midpoint **Auto Find Progress**.
- If the software displays "No work progress found" after clicking this button, please follow the steps below to troubleshoot the problem:
   - Verify that the output folder exists
   - Confirm that there is a video file named `chunk-xxx-yyyyyy-zzzzzz` in the output folder, if it does not exist, it means that there is no unrecoverable work progress
   - Confirm that the **last 10 digits** of the output folder are the same as the **task id** of the input file, if not, please manually change the task id and click the button to try again.
   - If the problem still cannot be solved, please move the mouse over the option button, read the option description carefully, and follow the prompts to fill in appropriate values in **Start Block Count and Start Input Frame Number**.

### What should I do if the supplementary frame effect is not silky

- In this case, there may be duplicate frames in the original video, or animation (with 1 beat N), you can try to enable duplicate frame removal in the **Transition Recognition and Animation Optimization Tab**, and adjust the deduplication value.

### What to do if the image of the exported video is noisy

- Before complementing the frame, go to the encoding quality setting **lower the rendering quality CRF value**, or **adjust the compression preset**.

### What should I do if the graphics card usage is low?

- First, in the task manager, click the small triangle next to the 3D occupancy rate and replace it with **CUDA**.
- **CUDA usage is generally around 85% or higher is normal**.
- If the usage is still low, please check whether the CPU utilization reaches 100%; if it reaches 100%, it means that the software encounters a CPU bottleneck. In this case, you can adjust other options until the graphics card usage reaches more than 80%.

### What should I do if the frame-filling video is distorted?

- If this happens in animation supplementary frames, it is recommended to turn off the deduplication frame, or reduce the deduplication value, or try to increase the optical flow scale to reduce the possibility of picture jelly. **
- If you have the skills related to video editing, you can patiently use different parameters to add more frames to produce several videos, and splicing each segment with an excellent result.
- If the embedded subtitles (hard subtitles, burned subtitles) are distorted, there is currently no better solution. If you want to add frames to animations, it is recommended to use resources without subtitles to add frames, and then find subtitles to embed.

### Will supplementing the frame for a long time hurt the graphics card

- Running CUDA for a long time will generally not affect the life of the graphics card, but if the heat dissipation measures are not done well, the temperature is too high, or running the frame recovery program after overclocking will still cause damage to the graphics card.
- According to the EULA (Software User Agreement), SVFI is not responsible for hardware damage caused by supplementary frames.

### What to do if the video memory is not enough

- The more video memory is occupied, the faster the speed will be. Even if the video memory is fully occupied by running SVFI programs, the speed may not be improved, because there are many other limiting factors such as the length of the rendering queue and the limitation of machine power consumption.

### What about Broken Pipe

- You can try to reduce the parameter selected by the N card hard-coded preset in the output quality setting, or turn off this function.
- Use CPU H.265 Fast or ProRes encoding

### Solve the abnormal size of SVFI window

Open the location of SVFI from Steam, the community version finds SVFI.Community.exe
The professional version finds SVFI.Professional.exe
Right click, properties, compatibility, change high DPI settings, override high DPI scaling behavior, system

### Fewer features available than in the tutorial?

- Not updated to latest version
- Some functions are in internal testing and will be made public later
- The purchased version is not the pro version

### How to only perform super resolution without supplementing frames at the same time

After setting the parameters, double the magnification of the supplementary frame, and then click one-key suppression (do not click one-key supplementary frame)

### How to make slow motion supplementary frames (upgrade, etc.)

For the actual shooting, refer to the time remapping in the custom code
For animation, first open the one-shot three-deduplication, and then refer to the time remapping in the custom coding, or use AE to perform post-processing such as variable speed and supplementary frames after one-shot three deduplication and re-replenishment
