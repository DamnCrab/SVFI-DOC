Modern display technology achieves any color of visible light by combining the three primary colors of different intensities. In image storage, the method of recording images by recording the red, green and blue intensity of each pixel is called the RGB model (RGB Model)</p><p>Among the common image formats, PNG and BMP are based on the RGB model.</p><p>For example, the original image:</p><figure><img src="'+a+'" alt="Original Picture" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Original Picture</figcaption></figure><p>Only display the intensity of the R G B channel respectively, the effect is as follows:</p><figure><img src="'+o+'" alt="RGB-R" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>RGB-R</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="'+n+'" alt="RGB-G" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>RGB-G</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="'+r+'" alt="RGB-B" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>RGB-B</figcaption></figure><p>Under the three channels, the amount of information and the degree of detail are not necessarily evenly distributed. For example, you can pay attention to the blush on Nan Xiaoniao&#39;s face, the degree of distinction is different on the three planes-the red plane is almost impossible to distinguish, and the difference is mainly caused by the green and blue planes. On the peripheral white cheeks, the three colors are almost saturated; but in the flush part, only the red is saturated, and the green and blue are not saturated. This is what causes the red to stand out.</p><h3 id="yuv-model" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#yuv-model" aria-hidden="true">#</a> YUV model</h3><p>In addition to the RGB model, there is also a widely used model called the YUV model, also known as the Luma-Chroma model. It converts the three channels of RGB into a channel representing brightness (Y, also known as Luma) and two channels representing chroma (UV, and becomes Chroma) through mathematical conversion.</p><p>The YUV model does something similar. Another representation is obtained through a reasonable conversion of the RGB data. Under the YUV model, there are different implementations. Take a more commonly used YCbCr model: it converts RGB into a brightness (Y), and blue chroma (Cb) and red chroma (Cr). You don&#39;t need to understand the complex formula behind the conversion, just look at the effect:</p><p>Only the luma channel:</p><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="YUV-Y" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>YUV-Y</figcaption></figure><p>Only shades of blue:</p><figure><img src="'+l+'" alt="YUV-Cb" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>YUV-Cb</figcaption></figure><p>Only shades of red:</p><figure><img src="'+h+'" alt="YUV-Cr" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>YUV-Cr</figcaption></figure><p>In image and video processing and storage, YUV format is generally more popular for the following reasons:</p><ol><li><p>The sensitivity of the human eye to brightness is much higher than that of chroma, so the effective information seen by the human eye mainly comes from brightness. The YUV model can assign most of the effective information to the Y channel. The UV channel has relatively less information recorded. Compared with the more even distribution of the RGB model, the YUV model concentrates most of the effective information in the Y channel, which not only reduces the amount of redundant information, but also facilitates compression</p></li><li><p>Maintain backward compatibility with black and white display devices</p></li><li><p>In image editing, it is more convenient to adjust the brightness and color saturation under the YUV model.</p></li></ol><p>Almost all video formats, as well as the widely used JPEG image format, are based on the YCbCr model. When playing, the player needs to convert the YCbCr information into RGB through calculation. <strong>This step is called Rendering</strong></p><p>Records for each channel, usually represented by integers. For example, RGB24 has 8 bits for each RGB, and uses 0~255 (8bit binary number range) to represent the strength of a certain color. The YUV model is no exception. It also uses integers to represent the height of each channel.</p><h3 id="color-depth" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#color-depth" aria-hidden="true">#</a> color depth</h3><p>Color depth (bit-depth), which is what we usually call 8bit and 10bit, refers to the precision of each channel. 8bit means that each channel is represented by an 8bit integer <code>(0~255)</code>, and 10bit is displayed by a 10bit integer <code>(0~1023)</code>. 16bit is <code>0~65535</code></p><p>(Note that the above statement is imprecise. When video is encoded, not all ranges of <code>0~255</code> can be used, but may be reserved, and only a part of it is used, such as <code>16~235</code> .This we will not expand in detail)</p><p>Your display is 8bit, which means it can display all the intensities of each RGB channel from 0 to 255. However, the color depth of the video is the color depth of YUV. When playing, YUV needs to be converted to RGB through calculation. Therefore, the high precision of 10bit is indirect, which increases the precision in the calculation process to make the final color more delicate.</p><p>How to understand 8bit display, it is necessary to play 10bit:</p><p>The radius of a circle is 12.33m, find its area, keep two decimal places.</p><p>The accuracy of the radius is given two decimal places, and the result also requires two decimal places, so how high the accuracy of pi needs to be? Only two decimal places?</p><p>Taking pi=3.14, the calculated area is 477.37 square meters</p><p>Taking pi=3.1416, the calculated area is 477.61 square meters</p><p>The accuracy of taking pi is high enough, and the calculated area is 477.61 square meters. So taking pi=3.1416 is enough, but 3.14 is not enough.</p><p>In other words, even if the precision requirement of the final output is low, it does not mean that the numbers involved in the calculation and the calculation process can maintain low precision. Under the premise that the final output is 8bit RGB, the reason why 10bit YUV still has an accuracy advantage over 8bit YUV is here. In fact, after 8bit YUV conversion, the coverage accuracy is about 26% of 8bit RGB, and after 10bit conversion, the accuracy can cover about 97% - do you want your 8bit display to play 97% of the fineness? Look at 10bit.</p><p>The 8bit precision is insufficient, mainly manifested in areas with low brightness, which is easy to form color bands.</p><figure><img src="'+c+'" alt="Color Ribbon" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Color Ribbon</figcaption></figure><p>Note that the circle on the right side of the picture has the same effect as the wave. This is the performance of insufficient color accuracy.</p><p>The advantage of 10bit is not only the improvement of display accuracy, but also has advantages over 8bit in terms of improving video compression rate and reducing distortion. This aspect will not be expanded.</p><h2 id="brief-description-of-clarity-and-quality" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#brief-description-of-clarity-and-quality" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Brief description of clarity and quality</h2><blockquote><p>A frequently seen saying: &quot;The resolution of this video is 1080p&quot;. In fact, after reading the above, you should know that 1080p is only the resolution of the video, and it cannot directly represent the definition-for example, I can upscale a 480p dvd video to 1080p, so what? Has its clarity improved?</p></blockquote><p>The quality of the video is determined by the following points</p><ol><li>The quality of the source.</li></ol><p>As the saying goes, the upper beam is not straight and the lower beam is crooked. If the quality of the source itself is poor, don&#39;t expect to get any better than that. Therefore, suppressors tend to choose a better source for suppressionâ€”for example, BDRip is generally better than TVRip, even if it is 720p. Blu-ray is also divided into sales regions. For example, for a Japanese cartoon, the Japanese version sold in Japan generally has better picture quality than the US version, Taiwan version, and Hong Kong version. By choosing a better source, you can give priority to the picture quality.</p><ol start="2"><li>Playback conditions.</li></ol><p>Whether the audience has used enough hardware and software to support high-quality playback. That&#39;s why we popularized good players while releasing Rip; sometimes a good player is better than how much effort was put into production.</p><ol start="3"><li>Bit rate input VS encoding complexity.</li></ol><p>The time and space complexity of the video, and called the encoding complexity. Videos with high encoding complexity often have many details and high dynamics (such as &quot;Magical Girl Madoka Theatrical Version: Rebellious Story&quot;). Such videos naturally require a higher bit rate to maintain an excellent viewing effect.</p><p>On the contrary, some videos have low coding complexity (for example, &quot;Would you like some rabbits today&quot;, with less dynamics and soft line details), this kind of video saves bit rate.</p><ol start="4"><li>Efficiency and rationality of code rate allocation.</li></ol><p>How effective the same bit rate can be is called efficiency. For example, H264 is more efficient than the previous RealVideo; 10bit is more efficient than 8bit; the encoder is advanced, the parameters are set reasonably, and all kinds of high-end parameters of the encoder are fully enabled (usually at the cost of encoding time), and the bit rate efficiency is high.</p><p>The rationality is whether the code rate is reasonable or not in terms of space-time distribution. If the distribution is reasonable, the viewing effect for the audience will be more unified and coordinated. The efficiency and rationality of the bit rate distribution is a requirement for producers, who are required to have a good understanding of film source analysis and parameter settings.</p><p>If the bit rate allocation and rationality are done well, it is often possible to produce conscientious works with low bit rate and high image quality.</p><ol start="5"><li>Preprocessing before encoding. There are three types of preprocessing:</li></ol><ul><li><p>Objective fixes. Emphasis on repairing the inherent defects of the film source, such as jaggies, color bands, halos, etc.</p></li><li><p>Subjective adjustment, emphasizing the adjustment of the film source to be more suitable for human eyes, such as moderate sharpening and color adjustment (sometimes you can use scientific methods to determine that there is a problem with the color of the film source, and then fix it accordingly).</p></li><li><p>Remove invalid high-frequency information, such as noise reduction, to avoid wasting bit rate on invalid noise points</p><p>If the preprocessing is done well, it can often surpass the source in terms of image quality, or save bit rate overhead without sacrificing clarity.</p><p>But preprocessing is a double-edged sword. While optimizing, side effects may be introduced. Operations such as noise reduction, anti-aliasing, and halo removal will inevitably lose some effective details (more or less, depending on the level of the producer); subjective adjustments are likely to introduce side effects (such as excessive sharpening will cause aliasing and halo Wheel), or become the author&#39;s self-satisfaction, forming a deception to the audience.</p></li></ul><p>To sum up, an excellent picture quality is jointly determined by the film source, the producer, and the viewer; the bit rate is only a part of the factor, not the decisive effect.</p>',56);function x(B,R){const i=p("ExternalLinkIcon");return f(),u("div",null,[e("div",y,[v,e("p",null,[t("The following content is taken from "),e("a",w,[t("FXXS-Encode-Guide"),m(i)]),t(", thanks for their efforts")])]),_])}const G=d(b,[["render",x],["__file","01.Image representation and quality.html.vue"]]);export{G as default};
