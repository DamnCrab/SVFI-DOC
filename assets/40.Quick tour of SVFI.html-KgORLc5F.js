This software is dedicated to upgrading the stuttering low frame rate video to smooth high frame rate video.</p><p>Regardless of whether you have had any similar video-frame-interpolation experience before, please believe that if you follow the process below, you will have a pleasant experience.</p><ol><li>Make sure your graphics card meets the minimum requirements of this software: <strong>GTX 750Ti</strong> and above, graphics card above <strong>Maxwell</strong> architecture. If you do not meet this requirement, please refund and stop the loss in time, and use other frame-filling software.</li><li>Find SVFI on the content library page of Steam</li></ol><figure><img src="'+e+'" alt="img" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>img</figcaption></figure><ol start="3"><li>Start SVFI</li></ol><figure><img src="'+t+'" alt="img" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>img</figcaption></figure><ol start="4"><li>Wait for the software to start, you will see the following blank operation page.

Please note that this tutorial is for the full series of SVFI 3.x versions, and the software version number you see may be different from the screenshot. <ul><li>To add frames to a <strong>video</strong>, you first need to select the option ❶ &quot;Input Video File&quot; below, and select the video to be added in the pop-up file selection window.</li><li>You can also &quot;drag&quot; the video directly into window ❷.</li></ul></li></ol><figure><img src="'+n+'" alt="img" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>img</figcaption></figure><ol start="5"><li><p>After importing a video, we need to make some basic settings.</p><ul><li><p>First thing: From option ❶ &quot;Set Output Folder&quot;, select the location of the completed frame video, which is <strong>Output Folder</strong>. If not specified, the output video with completed frames will be in the <strong>folder where the input video is located</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Set the option ❷ &quot;Output file format&quot; to determine the video format of the completed frame as .mp4, .mkv or .mov. The mp4 file is more versatile, mkv supports more types of audio, and mov uses fewer scenes. For Apple Eco clips. <strong>Please try to be consistent with the input video, if the format of the input video is not among the above three, use mkv.</strong></p></li><li><p>You will find that the frame rate of the input video has been displayed on the left side of option ❸. You can directly select the frame rate multiplier of the supplementary frame in option ❸ &quot;frame interpolation rate&quot;, or manually fill in the frame rate in ❹ &quot;Output frame rate&quot;. <strong>You can fill in any number, 60 or 120</strong>, SVFI will handle everything for you.</p></li></ul></li></ol><figure><img src="'+s+'" alt="img" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption>img</figcaption></figure><ol start="6"><li>Congratulations, you have completed all the necessary settings.
