If not specified, the output video of the interpolated frame will be in the <strong>folder where the input video is located</strong>.</p></li><li><p>Set the option ❷ &quot;Output file format&quot; to determine the format of the interpolated frame video as <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.mkv</code> or <code>.mov</code>. The <code>.mp4</code> file has better versatility, <code>.mkv</code> supports more types of audio, and <code>.mov</code> is less used, generally for Apple ecological editing. <strong>Please try to keep consistent with the input video. If the format of the input video is not in the above three, use mkv.</strong></p></li><li><p>You will find that the frame rate of the input video is already displayed on the left side of option ❸. You can directly select the frame rate multiple for frame interpolation in option ❸ &quot;Frame rate multiple&quot;, or manually fill in the frame rate in ❹ &quot;Output frame rate&quot;. <strong>You can fill in any number, 60 or 120</strong>, SVFI will handle everything for you.</p></li></ul></li></ul><figure><img src="'+h+'" alt="" tabindex="0" loading="lazy"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>',13),v=t("strong",null,"Interpolate",-1),y=t("li",null,[e("Before clicking ❺ "),t("strong",null,"Interpolate"),e(", in order to prevent errors, please close any other software that may occupy the video memory.")],-1),w={href:"https://steamcommunity.com/app/1692080/discussions",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function _(b,k){const n=o("RouterLink"),a=o("ExternalLinkIcon");return s(),l("div",null,[g,t("ul",null,[t("li",null,[e("Congratulations, you have completed all the necessary settings.
