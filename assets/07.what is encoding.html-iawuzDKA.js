Please do not suppress it if it is not necessary. 4k SDR WEB sources (generally from overseas streaming media such as Netflix and Prime Video) are currently rated well, and may be better than 1080p BD sources, and can be used for comparison with compressed 1080p videos.</p><p>For animation, the BD original disk is preferred, followed by high-quality WEB sources such as Crunchyroll</p><div class="hint-container warning"><p class="hint-container-title">Warning</p><p>It is not recommended to re-encode the video that has already been encoded.

The encoding process mainly deals with source processing, and fixes obvious common problems in the source, usually including dirty edges, color bands, fragments, color deviation, gamma correction, etc.; removes black edges, and removes black borders in the 16:9 ratio of the source ;Suppress space, mainly re-encoding the source with a higher compression method, usually a lossy method.</p><p><strong>Transparency Comparison</strong>: Transparency is an index that evaluates the degree of similarity between codes. Good transparency means that even experienced coders cannot clearly distinguish the gap between the suppressed work and the source.</p><p>According to the functions of I, P, and B frames, during the encoding process, the encoder generally respects the content of the I frame, even if it is compressed with inferior quality, it will not be significantly converted; for the p frame, the encoder can be converted into The B frame is encoded to save space, and the B frame is re-encoded. Therefore, the transparency should be judged from the comparison of the conversion quality of P-&gt;B and B-&gt;B in the source and suppression.</p><p><strong>Bloating</strong>: It is called bloated, which means that the code rate is higher under the same transparency. According to the more widely accepted rules of suppression, when the code rate of the compressed work is too close to the source, it is also considered Bloating, and the values ​​are as follows: (x265 recommends a smaller ratio)</p><table><thead><tr><th style="text-align:center;"></th><th>1080p</th><th>720p</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="text-align:center;">Original disk rate ratio</td><td>75%</td><td>50%</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="hint-container tip"><p class="hint-container-title">Tips</p><p>SVFI uses prefabricated compression parameters to suppress the video stream after super resolution or frame complementation.
